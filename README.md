# 🤖 Industry-Specific LLM Bot

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building an industry-specific conversational bot using pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs). The model is fine-tuned with domain-relevant data to improve contextual understanding and provide meaningful responses to user queries.

The system leverages Hugging Face models and is trained using Google Colab with T4 GPU, keeping training lightweight and accessible.
